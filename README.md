My goal:  create a web blog using Python and Flask

See process from back end to front end on how to produce a working website

1. Find a tutorial and follow steps
2. Install virtual environment
3. Install packages within Virtualenv: Flask, Peewee, markdown, micawber, beautiful soup
4. Ran into an issue with the code after following steps
5. Learned that I was missing an enourmous amount of code

Templates
  bootstrap-for customization
  holds all of the html code
  base.html defines HTML structure of the site
    
Static media
  css
  
Deploy site to heroku
